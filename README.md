# Zenith

## About
As part of the DevMobil course of the 3rd year of media engineering, we realized an application mainly with Ionic6, Angular and TypeScript.

The objective here was to build the front-end of our application following the first part of the course, where we had developed the back-end. See more about the [first part of the project.](https://github.com/Meryl-D/zenith-api)

Zenith is an app that lets you journal your travels and share them with other users.
* You can post places that you visited, with a picture, a description and a location.
* You have two view modals, the main one is a map and the other one is a basic feed, as you can see on Instagram.
